# Coming Soon
A place for Adies in the classroom and internship to anonymously submit a question to Alumni when you need support but are unsure who to ask, or are feeling nervous about reaching out for help. Sometimes being a student in Ada can feel isolating, and it's easy to feel like you're the only one who is struggling with something. However, its very likely that you are not alone in your experience. Share your story here and get advice from alumni to help yourself and others stay connected to our community.
